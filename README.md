| Category | Research Gap | Explanation |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Mobile Sinks and Security Frameworks** | Limited Integration of Mobile Sink Strategies with Comprehensive Security Frameworks | Existing studies, such as those by Guang et al. and Liu et al., explore mobile sink strategies and security frameworks independently, but there is a lack of integrated solutions that optimize mobile sink trajectories while ensuring robust security measures for WSNs. This gap highlights the need for unified frameworks that incorporate both mobility and security considerations. |
| **Adaptability to Attack Models** | Insufficient Adaptability to Multiple Attack Models | Current security mechanisms in WSN data gathering tend to address specific types of attacks, such as collusion or issues in unattended WSNs. However, adaptive frameworks capable of identifying and mitigating multiple attack vectors in real-time are limited, indicating a need for comprehensive, flexible security approaches that do not compromise network performance. |
| **Multi-Objective Optimization** | Lack of Decision Maker Preference Integration in Multi-Objective Optimization | While there has been progress in multi-objective optimization techniques for WSNs, limited research effectively incorporates decision maker preferences, especially within security-aware contexts. Saad et al.'s work on social class optimization addresses some aspects, but more dynamic frameworks that can balance multiple objectives and allow real-time preference adjustment are needed for practical applications. |

These identified research gaps suggest directions for future studies focused on enhancing WSN data gathering by developing frameworks that simultaneously address mobile sink optimization, multi-faceted security challenges, and the inclusion of decision-maker input for adaptive, holistic solutions in real-time applications.
