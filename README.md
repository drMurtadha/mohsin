## Digest of  the literature review

| Category | Research Gap | Explanation |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Mobile Sinks and Security Frameworks** | Limited Integration of Mobile Sink Strategies with Comprehensive Security Frameworks | Existing studies, such as those by Guang et al. and Liu et al., explore mobile sink strategies and security frameworks independently, but there is a lack of integrated solutions that optimize mobile sink trajectories while ensuring robust security measures for WSNs. This gap highlights the need for unified frameworks that incorporate both mobility and security considerations. |
| **Adaptability to Attack Models** | Insufficient Adaptability to Multiple Attack Models | Current security mechanisms in WSN data gathering tend to address specific types of attacks, such as collusion or issues in unattended WSNs. However, adaptive frameworks capable of identifying and mitigating multiple attack vectors in real-time are limited, indicating a need for comprehensive, flexible security approaches that do not compromise network performance. |
| **Multi-Objective Optimization** | Lack of Decision Maker Preference Integration in Multi-Objective Optimization | While there has been progress in multi-objective optimization techniques for WSNs, limited research effectively incorporates decision maker preferences, especially within security-aware contexts. Saad et al.'s work on social class optimization addresses some aspects, but more dynamic frameworks that can balance multiple objectives and allow real-time preference adjustment are needed for practical applications. |

### Problem Statement

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are critical for various modern applications, including environmental monitoring, industrial Internet of Things (IoT), and infrastructure security. However, as the complexity and scale of these networks grow, existing data gathering techniques face significant limitations in terms of efficiency, security, and adaptability. While the integration of mobile sinks, multi-objective optimization, and security mechanisms shows potential to address these issues, current research lacks cohesive frameworks that simultaneously optimize these aspects. Specifically, there are three primary gaps in the existing literature: (1) limited integration of mobile sink strategies with comprehensive security frameworks, resulting in suboptimal data gathering performance in security-sensitive environments; (2) insufficient adaptability to diverse attack models, which leaves WSNs vulnerable to multi-vector threats; and (3) a lack of decision maker preference integration in multi-objective optimization, reducing flexibility and practical applicability in real-time, dynamic contexts.

Without addressing these gaps, WSNs will continue to face vulnerabilities and inefficiencies that compromise their effectiveness in critical applications. Therefore, this research aims to develop a unified, adaptive framework that combines mobile sink optimization, robust security mechanisms, and flexible multi-objective optimization methods incorporating decision maker preferences. Such a framework is crucial for enhancing the resilience, efficiency, and adaptability of WSNs, ensuring their reliability in diverse and evolving operational contexts.
